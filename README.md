# Getting started

```bash
npx mercurjs marketplace
```

# What is Mercur?

Mercur is the first JavaScript open-source platform for building multi-vendor marketplaces. Built on top of Medusa.js, it simplifies the development of customized marketplaces.

## Why Mercur?

After seeing the rising trend in multi-vendor business models and setting up several marketplaces from scratch at Rigby, we wanted to eliminate the repetitive setup of marketplaces.

The aim is to enable users to start a new marketplace in about five minutes, providing a strong starting point for anyone looking to build their own multi-vendor platform.

Medusa is an amazing and strong foundation for building marketplaces but requires a few modifications to adjust to this business model. We wanted a faster way to get these platforms up and running ‚Äî Mercur is that accelerator for building multi-vendor marketplace with Medusa.js as a core.

## Goals

We aim to make Mercur adaptable for various marketplace types, such as rental or service marketplaces. We're also building an ecosystem of plugins tailored to multi-vendor setups, including solutions for payment distributions like Stripe.

Feel free to share your ideas on our Discord, how you imagine the development of this project.

## Project Components:

![Mercur Architecture](https://rigby-web.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/mercur-mvm-arch.png)

- **Core:** The backbone of Mercur, handling the primary operations and data flow essential for marketplace functionality.
- **Admin:** Provides a control panel for marketplace administrators to manage vendors, orders, settings, and more.
- **Vendor:** A dedicated interface for vendors to manage their products, orders, and profile details.
- **Storefront:** The frontend where customers browse products, place orders, and interact with the marketplace. It is a customized version of the Medusa.js Next.js Starter.

## Project Features:

- **Vendor Registration:** Allows new vendors to sign up and await approval from marketplace administrators.
- **Vendor Profiles:** Enables vendors to create and customize their profiles on the marketplace.
- **Vendor Authorization by Admin:** Admins can review and authorize vendor registrations to maintain marketplace standards.
- **Role-based Access:** Ensures users have permissions appropriate to their role within the marketplace.
- **Order Splitting:** Facilitates the distribution of orders among multiple vendors involved in a single transaction.
- **Vendor Shipping Management:** Vendors can manage their shipping logistics independently within the platform.
- **Commission Management:** Admins can set up and manage commission rates from vendor sales.

## Getting started üöÄ

Create a new Mercur project with just one command:

`npx @mercur generate marketplace`

You will be asked to enter the project's name and select the project‚Äôs modules (admin / vendor / storefront) platform you wish to use. Once selected, the CLI will create project files in the directory matching your project name.
